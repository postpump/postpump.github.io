## Land Use Regulations

Washington County regulates the land use of gas stations in [section 430-123 of their development codes](https://library.municode.com/or/washington_county/codes/community_development_code?nodeId=ARTIVDEST_430SPUSST_430-123SESTCAWA). However, there are no special setback requirements for gas stations and their potential economic, health, and environmental impacts.


## Stormwater Regulations

[CleanWater Services](https://www.cleanwaterservices.org) manages the stormwater runoff for Washington County. However, there are no specific considerations for the unique nonpoint source runoff of gas stations from leaking dispensers and vehicles.
