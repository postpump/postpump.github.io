## Frequency of Leaks

### Oregon DEQ Annual Leak Report, 2021

Oregon DEQ reported 50 Underground Storage Tank releases between October 1st 2020 and September 30th 2021 in their [annual report](/assets/docs/oregon/oregon-deq-2021-ust-report.pdf). For a sense of scale, 50 leaks means 2.8% of the 1,796 regulated Oregon Underground Storage Tank facilities leaked in one year. And many of the leaks in the DEQ database are not detected until the tank is decommissioned. Also, it is worth understanding from the Oregon DEQ annual report that even if the tank itself is working perfectly USTs can leak from their dispensers, piping, or have spills caused from delivery hardware.

### Summary of State Programs and Data on Abandoned Underground Storage Tanks and Facilities, 2017

This report has a lot of data from a bunch of different states. Unfortunately, due to the use of averages, no information on cleanup requirements, and the wide range of dates covered no useful conclusions can really be drawn from the report. It is included for completeness primarily and as a reference for to the variety of State laws that apply to USTs.

## Economic 

The total cost of gas station cleanup can be difficult to find. If the government has to step in the number of involved agencies and funding sources often complicate matters. However, we are trying our best to find examples.

### Senz Automotive Service, Yamhill Oregon


In November 2021 Brandon Philips made a public records request for Senz Automotive Service in Yamhill, Oregon. This site has a long and complex cleanup history with thousands of gallons of petroleum products lost which contaminated on-site soil, groundwater, and neighboring properties. So, far Oregon DEQ's cleanup costs have been **$514,466.53**. However, the cleanup is not complete and the damage to adjacent property values due to contamination is difficult to calculate.
