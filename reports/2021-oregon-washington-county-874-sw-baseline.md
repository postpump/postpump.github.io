> 874 SW Baseline Road was a former Etsby service station that was foreclosed in 2014. I am requesting a few records related to it.
> 
> The reason for these records requests is I am trying to establish the cost to the County on foreclosing on service stations, in particular the ongoing costs because service stations are costly to redevelop due to contamination from underground storage tanks.
> 
> - Total back taxes due to the County before foreclosure in 2014
> 
> - [The sales agreement approved by the board of commissioners](https://www.co.washington.or.us/Housing/News/private-sale-of-county-owned-property-approved-by-board-of-commissioners.cfm)
