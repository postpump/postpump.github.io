# Regulatory Guidance

A number of government agencies have put out guidance on siting of gas/fuel/service stations. This is a collection of some of those documents from various agencies.

If you have other suggested documents please email [brandon@postpump.org](mailto:brandon@postpump.org)

## General Guidance

New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services - [Preventing Groundwater Contamination at Gas Stations -- What Municipalities and Water Suppliers Can Do](https://www.des.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt341/files/documents/2020-01/dwgb-22-20.pdf)

> Given the likelihood that UST systems will release gasoline constituents (most commonly in the form of vapor leaks from underground piping systems or overfills of the UST, vehicle tank or portable container) and the possibility that spilled fuel will be carried off the fueling area by stormwater, municipal officials interested in providing the highest possible level of protection for groundwater used for drinking water should consider restricting the siting of gas stations as they would any other land use that is likely to contaminate groundwater. If the municipalityâ€™s zoning ordinance prohibits the location of certain high- risk land uses in wellhead protection areas, aquifer protection areas, or other areas of high-value groundwater, gas stations should be considered for inclusion in the list of prohibited land uses.
