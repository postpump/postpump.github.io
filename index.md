## About Us

Post Pump provides resources and research to help City, County, and State officials update Land Use and Zoning codes in an electric vehcile future. In particular we advocate for municipalities to begin planning for the decline and insolvency of gas/fuel/service stations across the United States and the financial and environmental impact of station abandonment.

## Is anyone doing this?

In 2021 Petaluma, CA became the first city to ban the contstruction of new fuel stations. In their [City Land Use Code](https://petaluma.municipal.codes/ZoningOrds/4.Tables) you can now see that in all zones Fuel Stations are marked as "Use Not Allowed".
