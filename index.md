## About Us

Post Pump provides resources and research to help City, County, and State officials update their municipalities Land Use and Zoning codes in an electric vehicle future. In particular we advocate for municipalities to begin planning for the decline and insolvency of gas/fuel/service stations across the United States and the financial and environmental impact of station abandonment.

## Land Use and Zoning

### What zoning could exist to reduce the risks from service/fuel/gas stations?

- **Short term** (conservative plan): service/fuel/gas stations are required to have a 100-500+ foot setback from sensitive sites like wetlands, parks, residences, schools, or other environmentally sensitive areas from the dangers related to underground storage tanks.

- **Medium term** (modest plan): service/fuel/gas stations are not allowed in any normal commercial zoning. Instead specifically zoned areas are chosen for service stations. These "Service Station Zones" are be chosen for their distance from wetlands, parks, residences, schools, or other environmentally sensitive areas.

- **Long term** (ultimate plan): service/fuel/gas stations are not allowed to be constructed.

### Is anyone changing zoning for service/fuel/gas stations?

In 2021 Petaluma, CA became the first city to ban the construction of new fuel stations. In their [City Land Use Code](https://petaluma.municipal.codes/ZoningOrds/4.Tables) you can now see that in all zones Fuel Stations are marked as "Use Not Allowed".

In 2014 Montgomery County, MD passed Ordinance amendment that requires a 500ft setback from "dwelling unit; public or private school; park; playground; day care center; any outdoor use categorized as a Civic and Institutional use or a Recreation and Entertainment use; or any wetland, stream, river, flood plain, or environmentally sensitive area."

## What Should I Read Next?

We have a number of [Data & Reports](/reports) to provide context on the economic and environmental costs of service stations. For a more general overview of the issues outlined there are also a number of [News Articles](/articles) related to the issue of abandoned service stations and the economic pinch they will be experiencing in the coming decade.
