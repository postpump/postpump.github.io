## About Us

Post Pump provides resources and research to help City, County, and State officials update Land Use and Zoning codes in an electric vehicle future. In particular we advocate for municipalities to begin planning for the decline and insolvency of gas/fuel/service stations across the United States and the financial and environmental impact of station abandonment.

## Land Use and Zoning

### What zoning could exist to reduce the risks from service/fuel/gas stations?

- **Short term** (conservative plan): service/fuel/gas stations are required to have a 100+ foot setback from sensitive sites like wetlands, parks, residences, schools, or other environmentally sensitive areas from the dangers related to underground storage tanks.

- **Medium term** (modest plan): service/fuel/gas stations are not allowed in any normal commercial zoning. Instead specifically zoned areas are chosen for service stations. These "Service Station Zones" are be chosen for their distance from wetlands, parks, residences, schools, or other environmentally sensitive areas.

- **Long term** (ultimate plan): service/fuel/gas stations are not allowed to be constructed. This will likely require double digit percentage electric vehicle adoption in the area along with rapid multi percentage point adoption year over year.

### Is anyone changing zoning for service/fuel/gas stations?

In 2021 Petaluma, CA became the first city to ban the construction of new fuel stations. In their [City Land Use Code](https://petaluma.municipal.codes/ZoningOrds/4.Tables) you can now see that in all zones Fuel Stations are marked as "Use Not Allowed".

In 2014 Montgomery County, MD passed Ordinance amendment that requires a 500ft setback from "dwelling unit; public or private school; park; playground; day care center; any outdoor use categorized as a Civic and Institutional use or a Recreation and Entertainment use; or any wetland, stream, river, flood plain, or environmentally sensitive area."

## Reports

### Oregon DEQ Annual Leak Report

Oregon DEQ reported 50 Underground Storage Tank releases between October 1st 2020 and September 30th 2021 in their [annual report](https://www.oregon.gov/deq/tanks/Documents/USTPublicRecord.pdf). For a sense of scale, 50 leaks means 2.8% of the 1,796 regulated Oregon Underground Storage Tank facilities leaked in one year. And many of the leaks in the DEQ database are not detected until the tank is decommissioned. Also, it is worth understanding from the Oregon DEQ annual report that even if the tank itself is working perfectly USTs can leak from their dispensers, piping, or have spills caused from delivery hardware.

### Abandoned Underground Storage Tanks

> No one would argue that the best abandoned tanks program is one that prevents tanks from becoming abandoned in the first place.
