### Oregon DEQ Abandoned Tank Records Request 2021-11-03

> I would like to get records on the total costs, per site, of underground storage tank orphan site cleanups for service/gas/fuel stations.
> 
> My understanding is that Oregon DEQ project manages and hire engineering/construction firms to cleanup orphaned or abandoned sites so if possible including these details for each site would be very helpful:
> 
> - A site description or LUST #
> - Remediation project plan
> - Associated environmental engineering reports
> - Costs broken down by DEQ management, disposal, remediation, and other applicable categories
> - Start and end date of the cleanup project
> 
> If possible please include the last 4 years of orphan site cleanup data for fuel/service/gas stations. If that is too burdensome please prioritize gathering records for facilities that are on a variety of different environments: heavy clay with deep ground water, adjacent to a wetland, on-top of shallow ground water, etc. 
> 
> This data could help municipalities decide on land use and zoning policies based on cleanup costs associated to certain sensitive sites. Or it could be used by Operators to plan for their insurance needs. I will be making this data publicly available at postpump.org.
